This project focuses on evaluating how commensal bacteria in the human gut microbiome can biotransform (demethylate) organic MeHg to an inorganic Hg2+ form and identifying the microbial players and mechanisms. Hg2+ is not readily transported across the lumen of the GI and is more readily excreted than MeHg in the feces. Taken together, the process of demethylation in the gut, reduces the amount of mercury capable of entering systemic circulation and reaching target organs and also increased the elimination rate of mercury from the body. Identifying the bacteria capable of this process and understanding the mechanisms of this process in modulating MeHg toxicokinetics and toxicity will allow for the development of pre/probiotics and dietary supplementations capable of altering a individuals gut microbiome in a way that may protect them against MeHg uptake and accumulation at sensitive sites and thus increases an individuals resistance to toxicity from MeHg.
